## Environment Variables

This project uses environment variables for configuration. To set up the environment on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

The `.env.example` file contains sample environment variables with default values. To create your own `.env` file, run:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Development environment

For development, you can run the dev script, which builds the project, watches for file changes, and starts the app with auto-reloading:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
